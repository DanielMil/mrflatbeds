Maybe throw in some pictures. On the home Page Link the LTL EXPEDITE sliding thing to link to the right page.
On the home page remove now hiring book keepers. Just keep the drivers.
We need to change the hiring page. I need to make a simple write up and added it there with an email to send all resumes to.
 
Also can you update the LOGO everywhere with the new one.
